## Questions
- How do different functions localize to the same location in the human brain
  across people?
  - e.g. how is vision always localized to the occipital lobe?
  - Inductive biases in the brain structure, governed by genetics?
- Why does the brain prune so many connections after birth?
  - Is birth a kind of "random initialization"?
  - Do we create memories via _synapse elimination_?
  - Evidence that overwiring can cause hypersensitivity?
    - Grass
    - Meaningless sounds
- Why are there much fewer dendrites (~7 fold less) than axons?
- Why does the same axon connect to multiple dendritic spines on the same
  dendrite?
  - We are confident this is not by accident, because there are many other
    dendritic spines from other dendrites in the same area that the axon _does
    not_ connect to.
